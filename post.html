            <h3>September Edition: Are Electric Vehicles Truly Green? Examining Their Energy Sources</h3>
            <p>
              Electric Vehicles (EVs) are often seen as a green solution to address the carbon emissions produced by fossil-fuel-powered vehicles. However, an important question arises: are electric vehicles as clean as they are claimed to be? One key factor influencing this is the energy source used to charge their batteries. However, if electricity is still generated from fossil fuel power plants, such as coal or natural gas,...

            <h3>August Edition: Tides, Hidden Energy on the Seabed</h3>
            <p>
              Tidal energy is the energy generated by the change in the height and height of the sea level due to the gravitational force of the moon and the sun. When the moon and sun are in a certain position, they produce a gravitational attraction that causes the tides to ebb and flow. This process creates a difference between when the sea water reaches its highest point (high tide) and its lowest point (low tide). Tidal energy...
